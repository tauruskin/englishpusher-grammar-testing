/**
 * Regression tests for multiple-choice rendering.
 *
 * Bug: MultipleChoiceView rendered only `multipleChoice.question`. When the
 * gapped stem lives in `question.sentence` (the shape every topic uses after
 * the Quiz Bot de-duplication pass), the learner saw a bare prompt like
 * "Which option correctly completes the sentence?" with no sentence at all.
