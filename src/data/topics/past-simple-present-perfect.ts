 * Past Simple and Present Perfect

 *   - Present Perfect form: have/has + past participle
 *   - Present Perfect uses: general experiences, ever/never, relevant to present, unfinished periods
 *   - Past Simple: specific time in the past
 *   - Contrast: PP (no specific time) vs PS (specific time — last year, in 2019, yesterday)
 *   - Conversations: PP opens, PS adds detail
